# Identification of Ubiquitin-like SUMO Proteases in Rice (*Oryza sativa* L.)

<p align="justify">
In this work, we employed a range of computational techniques to describe and characterise the SUMOylation machinery in Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified and analysed the ubiquitin-like SUMO protease (ULP) system at the phylogenetic, transcriptional, and protein structural levels, focusing on the rice reference genome, a well-annotated Rice Population Reference Panel (RPRP), and wild rice genomes.

The workflow and scripts used for each step of the analysis are summarised in the figure below.
